# Emission Prediction and Optimization Framework

This project demonstrates a minimal workflow for forecasting emissions with machine learning and applying optimization when emissions exceed a threshold.

## Features
- **Data preprocessing**: missing-value imputation and feature scaling.
- **EmissionPredictor**: combines RandomForest and XGBoost and reports common metrics.
- **Process monitoring**: triggers optimization when emissions go beyond a user-defined level.
- **Particle Swarm Optimization**: tunes process parameters.
- **Demo script**: generates synthetic data and showcases the complete pipeline.

## Installation
1. Ensure Python 3.12+ is installed.
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost shap
   ```
   The `shap` library is optional; if it is not installed, SHAP-based explanations are skipped.

## Usage
Run the demo script:
```bash
python main.py
```
The script will train the models, print evaluation metrics, attempt to compute SHAP values, and run the PSO optimizer if emissions surpass the threshold.

## Project Structure
